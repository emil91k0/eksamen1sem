                    Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. When you design, you have to draw on your own fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to read/look at/use then why fucking bother? When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Learn from fucking criticism. Fuck. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Don’t worry about what other people fucking think. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. To go partway is
